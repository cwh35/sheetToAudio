Goals:
- Only identify treble clef, time signature, and tempo once
- Put key signature (hex value) in between treble clef and tempo
- Make sure the hex output matches Jack's input (capital letters) 
	- have it output as a uint8 or char
- If no dyanimc recognized, take the last one that was identified, or use default (ff)
- timeSig = 0xXX
- Tempo = 0xXX
- KeySig = 0x0X

Everything else is a dynamic or a note/rest
