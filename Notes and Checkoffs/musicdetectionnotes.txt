image registration - if the image is taken at an angle, correct it to normal orientation
get template for each note
train a support vector machine (classifier) - histogram of gradients (HOG) this is the feature generator
- gonna have a sliding window over the images, identify the image, classify the image
- run the algorithm with multiple window sizes

resources: openCV, SVM libraries, HOG for image recognition, MIDI conversion

does arduino have a HOG library or SVM library

try to get small raspberry pi and then build PCB around it for camera ports, and LCD screen

build own synthesizer (MIDI)


HOG descriptor focuses on the structure or shape of an object
- uses magnitude as well as angle of the gradient to compute the features
- image needs to be resized to 128 (height) x 64 (width) pixels
